Comparison Summary
The diff feature in Github allowed me to see changes and fixes that enhanced the functionality and adjusted the formatting.

1 
 The inital commit contained only the basic HTML structure with a headline and a simple paragraph.
 In the feature implementation I added a GIF using an <img> tag. Also, included styling to it and an alt descrbtion for the link.

2
 The bug version introduced a simple but commen problem: unclosed parentheses. This small mistake can cuse a lot of display errors.
 The fix was straightforward. I closed the tag and made sure all parentheses were matched and everything worked smoothly.
